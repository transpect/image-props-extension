# image-props-extension
XML Calabash extension step for reading image properties such as width

An XML Calabash extension for extracting image information
from PNG, JPEG, SVG etc. Whereas SVG is currently unsupported
due to an incompatibility between Batik and validator.nuâ€™s
htmlparser.

It requires several Apache libraries that are bundled with this repo.

xmlgraphics-commons-1.5.jar
commons-imaging-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

For SVG analysis, it needs 

 * batik-1.7/*
 * fop.jar

See http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt for the libraries'
licenses.

Usage example (from the checked-out directory):

calabash/calabash.sh extensions/transpect/ltx-image-identify/ltx-example.xpl

It requires
[calabash-distro](https://github.com/transpect/calabash-distro) and
[calabash-frontend](https://github.com/transpect/calabash-frontend) to
be installed (for example, by installing calabash-frontend with
recursive submodule checkout).

Step signature:

```xml
<p:declare-step type="tr:image-identify">
  <p:input port="source" primary="true" sequence="true"/>
  <p:output port="result" primary="true" sequence="true"/>
  <p:output port="report" sequence="true"/>
  <p:option name="href"/>
</p:declare-step>
```

tr:image-identify passes documents from its source to its result
port (this is because the step is better chainable this way). As a
side effect, it will create a c:results document with image properties
on the report port. The result (er, report) of the sample invocation
above looks like this:

```
<c:results xmlns:c="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc-step" name="logo-letex.png">
  <c:result name="mimetype" value="image/png"/>
  <c:result name="formatdescription" value="PNG Portable Network Graphics"/>
  <c:result name="formatdetails" value="Png"/>
  <c:result name="width" value="142px"/>
  <c:result name="height" value="58px"/>
  <c:result name="density" value="-1dpi"/>
  <c:result name="colorspace" value="RGB"/>
  <c:result name="transparency" value="false"/>
  <c:result name="compressionalgorithm" value="PNG Filter"/>
</c:results>
<c:results xmlns:c="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc-step" name="le-tex_venn.svg">
  <c:result name="mimetype" value="image/svg+xml"/>
  <c:result name="width" value="1000px"/>
  <c:result name="height" value="700px"/>
  <c:result name="density" value="96dpi"/>
</c:results>
```

## Compilation (Unix paths):

```
javac -cp ../../../calabash.jar:xmlgraphics-commons-1.5.jar:commons-imaging-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  ImageIdentify.java
```
   
### On Cygwin:

```
/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Java/jdk1.7.0_40/bin/javac \
  -cp $(cygpath -map ../../../calabash.jar:xmlgraphics-commons-1.5.jar:commons-imaging-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) \
  ImageIdentify.java
